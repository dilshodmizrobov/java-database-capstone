# User Stories - Java Database Capstone Project

## 1. As a User, I want to be able to create a new record
- So that I can store important data in the system.
- Example: Add a new student, task, or product to the database.

## 2. As a User, I want to be able to view all existing records
- So that I can quickly access and review the stored information.
- Example: List all students or tasks in a table format.

## 3. As a User, I want to be able to update an existing record
- So that I can correct mistakes or change outdated information.
- Example: Edit a studentâ€™s email address or update task status.

## 4. As a User, I want to be able to delete a record
- So that I can remove data that is no longer needed.
- Example: Delete a completed task or an old product.

## 5. As a User, I want input validation and error messages
- So that I do not enter incorrect or incomplete data.
- Example: Show an error if a required field is left empty.

## 6. As a User, I want confirmation before deleting data
- So that I do not accidentally remove important records.

## 7. As a Developer, I want the application to connect securely to a database
- So that the data is stored persistently and securely.

## 8. As a Developer, I want to separate business logic from the user interface
- So that the codebase is clean, maintainable, and testable.

## 9. As an Admin User, I want to have access to all data and additional controls
- So that I can manage the system efficiently.

## 10. As a User, I want to be able to search or filter records
- So that I can find specific data quickly.
- Example: Search for a task by name or a student by ID.
